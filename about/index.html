<hr />
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<hr />
<p>I find coding joyful. I also like to take technical complexity and understand it well enough to explain it to a 5-year-old. If you want to get to know me as the Father, Entrepreneur, Engineer, and Scientist read on. If you Just want to know what are the current Stacks/APIs/Languages I am working on scroll down to <strong>Latest stacks</strong> and <strong>Portfolio Summary</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="i-thrive-at-what-i-do">I Thrive at What I Do</h2>
<hr />
<p>The path is rewarding. I often get into a flow state when coding. That is where I feel at home and most productive. After being a father, I truly believe solving problems is my greatest passion and gift. As a Developer, this passion and gift create impact and value in the world.</p>
<p>I also find joy in breaking down hard technical problems in a way my 5-year-old daughter can understand (I have not yet figured out how to illustrate Ethereum clearly to her, any ideas? =). Being able to communicate concisely and clearly with non-technical team members is a rare and valuable skill. I enjoy practicing interdisciplinary communication.</p>
<p>My strength is technical at heart with honor badges forged through startup experiences and lessons learned with large corporate tape bottlenecks. I see light in elegant code, yet, I am not a purist. Sometimes a short term patch generating a passionate customer is worth infinitely more than 1000 indifferent passerbys. That very reason is why I also am a champion for dependable software architecture who’s complexity and depth should correlate with one’s resources, company’s life cycle, and direction.</p>
<p>I wonder why you have read this far. Thank You. If you continue you will find links to my projects, service APIs I know well, and further professional information.</p>
<p>Reach out if you feel joining forces can result in a sum greater than the parts. I strive to build deep relationships with those I work with and it always starts with ‘Hello’. Say Hello!</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="portfolio-summary">Portfolio Summary</h2>
<hr />
<p>Twelve combined years experience in Software Engineering/Architecture and Applied Computer Science. From Large Prime Cryptography pushing the boundaries of computing and computer languages to iOS Application pioneering, and teaching Software Development classes and mentoring at a four-year college. Also proud of cutting edge work with Emotiv in Brain Interface Research. Each of these projects pushed their respective technology’s boundaries outward and the experience of learning at the edge is full and priceless.</p>

<p>Recent tools and services I work with daily and are the freshest in my mind. All very good tools/services.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Agile M.</p>
    <p>Yes, it is buzzy. Nonetheless, I do like the Agile Manifesto, sprints, story points and the like. Yet, I am not going to insist on Agile where interest is lacking. Individuals and interactions come before process and tools and some teams might have greater working patterns than following this manifesto)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ruby on Rails</p>
    <p>“Cool, a new major version is out. Can’t wait to upgrade”. – said no rails dev ever</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Heroku Platform</p>
    <p>“What is behind the wall like? Don’t worry about it!” (goo.gl/4A8OBE )</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PostgreSQL</p>
    <p>Great on paper, great in practice, not great on market share. Yet!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Objective-C</p>
    <p>I know, I worked with Swift also but an legacy Obj-C app is most recent iOS app I worked on</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Twilio API</p>
    <p>Went to school with hire #4 and have been building Twilio apps since. I know Twilio’s API exceptionally well.</p>
